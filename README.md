# interpretable_ml_cnn_filters
This repo contains the python notebook aimed at visualising the filters of a CNN. The aim is to visualize the features that maximally activate the filters of a CNN model.This has been done by using gradient ascent to visualize images that maximally activate specific filters from different layers of the model VGG16. We have used TensorFlow as our machine learning framework.
